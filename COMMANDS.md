# Commands

**You never need a command** — plain language in any language works; Mops parses intent
and asks when ambiguous. Commands are optional thin aliases (a plugin nicety), grouped
below, aliases in parentheses; **arguments are free text** (`/move the crossfeed thing
to the next release` is fine). **`/multica-ops:mops <anything>`** is the free-text dispatcher (plugin commands are namespaced). A short **`/mops`** is installed on first run by the plugin's SessionStart hook — check it exists before quoting either form, and outside Claude Code there are no slash commands at all
(collision-proof vs Claude Code built-ins; namespaced `/multica-ops:<cmd>` also works) —
Mops the pug is the skill's mascot. *Where* column: 🖥️ console (heavy/machine/
interactive) · 🏢 Mops in Multica (presence/async) · ⇆ either.

**Setup**
| Command | Where | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `/init` | 🖥️ | bootstrap from zero: **day zero** (BOOTSTRAP §0) → three routing questions → shaping → interview → stand up. Full procedure: FLOWS |
| `/crew` | 🖥️ | **crew mode**: executors and gates, the owner is the product manager — no conductor, discovery or roadmap ceremony. Default offer after `/import`; adding a conductor later is an upgrade, not a redo |
| `/join` | 🖥️ | join an existing setup — `/audit` + interview delta, then gaps → fixes; reconcile an existing Mops in Multica. Full procedure: FLOWS |

**Features & roadmap**
| Command | Where | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `/research <question>` | ⇆ | point research without a feature: market, competitor, tech, pricing — cited findings land in `docs/research/`; feeds discovery, specs, and expert reviews |
| `/brand` | ⇆ | create or evolve the brand: new → brand discovery → book → owner approval → systematize (tokens/templates → design system, voice → guide); existing → audit with a complete/add/rework verdict per piece |
| `/audience` (`/personas`) | ⇆ | audience work: segments, ICP, personas as documents (and, if the Personas module is on, matching agents); built/refreshed from research, used by design and marketing |
| `/validate <what>` | ⇆ | run an artifact past the validators: **Experts squad** gives an evidence-backed verdict (spec, architecture, pricing, roadmap), **Personas squad** reacts as the audience (mockup walkthrough, copy, onboarding). Neither exists? Say so and offer to enable them (`/module experts on`, `/module personas on` — hires the lineup with your confirmation) |
| `/discovery <text>` | ⇆ | spin up a fuzzy idea: research · competitors · team brainstorm → proposal; flows into `/feature` |
| `/feature <text>` | ⇆ | add a feature mid-flight — raw description is fine: the conductor grills the user with questions → spec → **ICE** prioritization vs the backlog → proposed release slot → user approval → queued. Too fuzzy to spec? Offer to route through `/discovery` first |
| `/next` | ⇆ | start the next feature from ROADMAP.md (manual flow's main button) |
| `/ship [release]` (`/release`, `/launch`, `/deliver`) | 🖥️ | the **go-live step — whatever "live" means for this project**: ship code, launch a snack flavor, publish an episode, send the batch. Confirm gates green → do/hand off the release → release notes → tag → announce (deploy/announce are outward → **owner-confirmed**); writes the **cost/effort ledger** (below) and marks it shipped in ROADMAP |
| `/measure [feature\|release]` | ⇆ | close the loop: the Analyst pulls the success metrics set at discovery, compares to target, reports the outcome, files a **Learn** item back to the roadmap, and records the **cost/effort ledger** (tokens · $ · time · per agent/human) from `issue usage` |
| `/bug <text>` (`/urgent`, `/hotfix`, `/incident`) | ⇆ | the **urgent lane that jumps the queue** — a defect, recall, or correction (broken build, wrong label on a batch, bad copy live). Minimal spec → straight to Build + Review, owner notified; not ICE-prioritized like `/feature` |
| `/feedback <text>` | ⇆ | log an **incoming signal from users/customers** — a complaint, request, review, or idea — then **triage** it (assess/sort) and file it: small → backlog, bigger → a `/discovery`. Feeds the next `/roadmap` |
| `/roadmap` (`/prioritize` = its rescoring pass) | ⇆ | view / rebuild the release plan; re-run ICE scoring across backlog/releases; **release surgery**: cut a release (features → backlog), extend it (pull from backlog or `/feature` new ones), reprioritize |
| `/move <feature> <release\|backlog>` | ⇆ | move one feature between releases or to the backlog |
| `/drop <feature>` | ⇆ | remove a feature: cancel with a `Cancel reason: …` comment (or park to backlog if it may return) |

**Team**
| Command | Where | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `/team` | ⇆ | roster: agents, roles, models, squads, who is on what |
| `/hire <role\|person>` (`/invite`) | 🖥️ | add to the team — Mops asks **agent or real person**. Agent → role-builder. Person → `workspace member invite <email>` (owner-confirmed, outward) → ask title/tasks → set `/access` + `/reviews` → record in TEAM.md |
| `/fire <agent\|member>` (`/retire`) | 🖥️ | offboard — first **surface the risk**: what they own/block (open issues, squad leadership, sole-owner skills/integrations, review checkpoints held) → propose a new owner and reassign → then **agent**: remove from squads/routing, archive; **person**: Mops does the prep, but **says plainly that removing a real member is the owner's own action in the Multica app (no CLI)** — it never removes a human itself, and firing a human is owner-only via their own Mops |
| `/update <agent\|member>` (`/role`, `/edit`) | 🖥️ | reconfigure an existing member — **agent**: `agent update` (name/description/instructions), skills, squad, model tier; **person**: TEAM.md role + `/access` + `/reviews`. Also reassign a **project lead** (`project update --lead`) |
| `/squad` | 🖥️ | create/reshape squads: members, leader, routing instructions |
| `/module <name> on\|off` | 🖥️ | toggle an opt-in module (resident Mops (in Multica), design system & brand, experts, personas, Design QA, social…) |
| `/budget [amount/period]` | 🖥️ | set or show the envelope: amount + period, currency (USD default), credits/grants with expiries, what counts; reports burn, runway and cost per shipped feature, and re-proposes the stack if the number changes |
| `/access <member> <full\|features\|status\|…>` | 🖥️ | set what a workspace member may direct Mops to do; owner always full; destructive/spend always → owner |
| `/reviews` | ⇆ | manage human sign-off checkpoints: which flows/stages @mention which person before proceeding (image-gen, publish, a stage, every feature); add / remove / list |

**Autonomy & automation**
| Command | Where | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `/autonomy [manual\|auto]` (`/hiring [manual\|auto]` = its hiring dial) | 🖥️ | presets: manual = user-started features + confirmed hires; auto = non-stop + autonomous hiring. Fine dials: `/autonomy flow auto`, `/autonomy hiring manual`. Switches are boundary-safe (see Operating modes) |
| `/autopilot` | 🖥️ | create/list/delete scheduled automations (cron/webhook): nightly sweeps, PR-merged hooks, social cadence — set up here, they *run* inside Multica |

**Operations**
| Command | Where | Routes to |
|---|---|---|
| `/status` | ⇆ | Mops digest: in flight, finished, stuck & why, waiting on the user, spend snapshot, **ripe deferrals from LATER.md**, and **pending owner approvals batched into one digest** (not scattered pings) — Mops in Multica answers this natively |
| `/recover` (`/continue`) | 🖥️ | revive after limits (rerun interrupted, revive marker-less cancels) |
| `/start` · `/stop` | 🖥️ | daemon start / stop (local runtime) |
| `/workspace [name]` | 🖥️ | list your workspaces / switch the active one (`workspace switch`); Mops confirms which company it's acting on when several exist |
| `/health` (`/runtimes`) | 🖥️ | full-circle check: runtimes (online/stale + affected agents), integrations & MCP reachability, API tokens/secrets (presence + probe + expiry), **branch protection where a remote exists** — a fence nobody installed is exactly the failure this skill warns about, daemon, limits → component → status → who it blocks → fix |
| `/upgrade [skill\|all]` | 🖥️ | **the one command for getting current** — four layers: this skill's bytes on your machine (it prints the line *you* run; a skill can't replace its own plugin), the workspace migration, imported skills, and the CLI locally and on runtimes **only when `active_task_count` is 0**. Update = new bytes; upgrade = your workspace moves to them. Diagram: WORKFLOW. Then: **re-screen the new version first** (an upgrade ships unreviewed third-party code and instructions — diff it against the version you screened, and read what changed in the prose, not only the scripts) → dry-run impact report (skill + dependent agents/squads/autopilots/guide) → commit current to `docs/skill-backups/` (git = history; pre-upgrade SHA logged in `UPGRADES.md`) → apply → reconcile → verify/rollback |
| `/switch <role\|all> <provider>` | 🖥️ | reassign runtime/model/thinking-level per agent, or an assisted whole-provider migration (install/auth/daemon + tier remap + smoke test) |
| `/audit` | 🖥️ | health **and** opportunities — not just defects: token burn, limit-killed runs, model-tier misfits, stalled/blocked issues, hygiene (guide/find-skills/instructions/labels), mention cycles, secrets, **design-system hygiene** (unsystematized one-offs, token drift, convention violations — Component Library Audit helps); **plus process improvements** (better stage/gate design, tier savings, skills worth creating, routing tweaks, automation candidates) and **integrity checks** (facts past their check-date, a missing or stale `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`DECISIONS.md`, gates where author and reviewer coincide, edits to locked surfaces, **always-loaded skill weight per agent** — over the ceiling means a role wants splitting, not pruning; **unsourced ICE scores**, and rankings that flip when a score moves by one); pulls in `/health`. Output: finding → recommendation → impact |
| `/connect <service>` (`/integration`) | 🖥️ | integrations: connect-or-create + **check the MCP registries first** (mcpservers.org, mcp.so, awesome-mcp-servers; mcpmarket.com leaderboards as the maintained-and-popular signal — an existing server beats hand-wiring) + **study the tool** (idioms/best practices → guide) + agent access (mcp_config/custom-env) + permission rules + register in `docs/TOOLING.md` |
| `/cli <command>` | 🖥️ | **raw Multica CLI escape hatch** — run or explain any `multica …` command directly, no methodology assumed (use it framework-free). Backed by the full surface in REFERENCE.md §10; Mops confirms flags via `--help`, and destructive/outward commands still need owner sign-off |
| `/import` | 🖥️ | bring a backlog in from another tracker (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Trello, CSV): extract → show the mapping → create parents then children, **unassigned**, with `source_id` in metadata so a rerun resumes. PLAYBOOKS |
| `/skill <create\|import\|optimize\|release>` | 🖥️ | the toolkit's lifecycle, conductor-owned: **create** (a routine seen twice → skill-creator → tested on a fresh agent → optimized → attached), **import** (screen for danger and injection → trim → attach **with provenance**), **optimize** (fail-closed compression; verbatim commands/paths/numbers, independent reviewer, `NOT_COMPRESSIBLE` is a valid answer), **release** (a proven skill → de-identified → the owner's own repo outside the workspace, owner-confirmed → re-imported as external so nothing drifts). PLAYBOOKS |
| `/sync` | 🖥️ | **two-way reconcile:** detect drift (skills/agents/squads/autopilots/labels/integrations changed outside Mops — e.g. the user imported a skill or edited an agent), study & record it into TEAM.md/guide/roadmap, flag conflicts and ask/fix; then push derived state (team snapshot, workspace details, Mops-in-Multica's instructions). The routine sibling of `/join`'s one-time audit |
| `/help` | ⇆ | list these commands and what Mops in Multica can do |

In the workspace the user talks to **Mops in Multica** (subtitle *"Executive Advisor ·
resident"*) — no commands needed, plain chat; Mops in Multica answers `/status`-style
questions natively and, for anything 🖥️, points the user back to the console.
